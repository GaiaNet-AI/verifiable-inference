While it only reaches an elevation of about 4,205 meters (13,796 feet) above sea level, its base extends down to a depth of over 6 kilometers (3.7 miles), making it approximately 10,203 meters (33,476 feet) tall.\n\nBut if you're asking about the tallest mountain in terms of prominence (the height difference between the summit and the lowest point on the surrounding terrain), then the answer is Mauna Kea as well.\n\nAnd finally, if you're wondering what the highest mountain on Earth used to be, it's a different story. About 60 million years ago, during the Paleogene period, the Indian tectonic plate collided with the Eurasian plate, causing massive uplift and creating the Himalayan mountain range. At that time, the mountain that existed was actually much taller than Mount Everest is today! It's estimated to have reached heights of over 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) above sea level.\n\nSo, depending on how you measure it, there are different answers to what the tallest mountain on Earth is!",
