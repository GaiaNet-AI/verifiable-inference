He proposed that gravity is not a force, but rather the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. According to this theory, the presence of mass and energy warps spacetime, affecting the motion of other objects.\n\nEinstein's groundbreaking work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and has had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and astronomy!",
