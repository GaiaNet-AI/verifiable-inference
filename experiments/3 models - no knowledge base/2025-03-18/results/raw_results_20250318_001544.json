According to general relativity, massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime around them, which affects not only their motion but also the path of light.\n\nEinstein's groundbreaking work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and had a profound impact on modern physics, astronomy, and engineering.\n\nWould you like to know more about relativity or Einstein's contributions?",
