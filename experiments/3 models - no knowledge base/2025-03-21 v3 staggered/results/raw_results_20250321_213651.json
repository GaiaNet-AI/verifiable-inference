That credit goes to Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain, who developed methods for mass-producing the antibiotic and demonstrated its effectiveness in treating infections in humans.

The first woman to win a Nobel Prize was actually Bertha von Suttnert, who received half of the 1901 Nobel Peace Prize along with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy for their work in promoting international arbitration and peace.\n\nBertha von Sutternert was an Austrian-British social worker, philanthropist, and women's rights activist.

It posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. The key principles include:\n\t* Time dilation: Time appears to pass slower for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n\t* Length contraction: Objects appear shorter to an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n\t* Relativity of simultaneity: Two events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another observer in a different state of motion.\n\n2. **General Relativity (1915)**: This theory expanded on special relativity by introducing gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. According to general relativity:\n\t* Gravity is not a force, but rather a consequence of mass and energy warping spacetime.\n\t* The curvature of spacetime around massive objects causes objects to move along curved trajectories (geodesics).\n\t* Time dilation and length contraction are also present in strong gravitational fields.\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and has had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and astronomy.",
