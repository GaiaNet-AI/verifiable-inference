He introduced two main components:\n\n1. **Special Relativity (1905)**: This theory challenged the long-held notion of absolute time and space. It states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. The speed of light is always constant, regardless of the observer's frame of reference.\n\n2. **General Relativity (1915)**: Building upon special relativity, this theory expanded on gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. It predicted phenomena like gravitational waves and black holes, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe's structure and behavior.\n\nEinstein's work in these areas not only transformed our comprehension of space and time but also had a profound impact on the development of modern physics, astronomy, and engineering.",

According to general relativity, the presence of mass and energy warps the fabric of spacetime, leading to phenomena such as gravitational redshift, black holes, and the bending of light around massive objects.\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and has had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and astronomy.",
