This theory challenged the long-held notion of absolute time and space, and introduced the famous equation E=mc\u00b2, which shows that mass and energy are equivalent.\n\n**General Relativity (1915)**: Einstein's general theory of relativity built upon special relativity and introduced the concept of gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. According to this theory, the presence of matter warps the fabric of spacetime, causing other objects to move along curved trajectories, which we experience as gravity.\n\nEinstein's work on the theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time, and had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and astronomy.",
